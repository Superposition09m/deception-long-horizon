# Data Quality Report: Activity Planning Dataset

This report assesses the quality of the `activity_planning` dataset based on internal consistency, logical structure, and plausibility.

**Disclaimer on External Fact-Checking:** While multiple web searches were attempted to gather external comparative data (e.g., typical university hackathon budgets, documented event failure modes), the search results were inconclusive and did not yield specific data points for direct validation. Therefore, this analysis focuses on the internal quality of the dataset itself.

---

## 1. Task Stream Analysis (`tasks.json`)

The `tasks.json` file defines a 14-step sequence for organizing a hackathon.

### 1.1. Logical Coherence and Completeness
- **Progression:** The task sequence follows a logical and chronological order, moving from high-level planning (Task 1: Overall Plan) to detailed execution and final operations (Task 14: On-site Ops Plan).
- **Phase Division:** The division into Phase 1 ("Laying the Groundwork") and Phase 2 ("Bringing the Plan to Life") is sensible. Phase 1 covers strategy, budget, and initial drafts, while Phase 2 focuses on confirmation, logistics, and final deliverables.
- **Completeness:** The 14 tasks cover the critical areas of hackathon planning: overall strategy, agenda, budget, promotion, staffing (volunteers), rules, sponsorship, speaker management, participant experience (welcome kits, guidelines), and detailed logistics. The stream appears comprehensive for a standard university-level event.
- **Dependencies:** The specified `dependencies` for each task are logical. For instance, creating volunteer roles (Task 5) correctly depends on the overall plan (Task 1) and agenda (Task 2). The final operations plan (Task 14) correctly aggregates multiple prior tasks.

### 1.2. Plausibility of Constraints
- **Budget:** The primary budget constraint is "<$15K for 60-120 participants". Task 3 provides a plausible breakdown:
  - Venue: $3-5K
  - Catering: $4-6K
  - Prizes: $1-2K
  - **Total:** $8-13K
  This breakdown is internally consistent and falls within the overall <$15K cap. For a university setting where venues may be subsidized and food choices are managed for cost, these figures are plausible.
- **Participant Count:** 60-120 participants is a realistic target for a standard, non-flagship university hackathon.
- **Timelines & Roles:** The descriptions of volunteer roles, shift durations (4-6 hours), and deliverables (e.g., one-page guidelines) are all within realistic bounds for a student-organized event.

### 1.3. Actionability and Clarity
- **Prompts:** The `base_prompt` for each task is clear, concise, and provides enough context for an AI assistant to generate a useful response.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** The `acceptance_criteria` are specific and measurable, which is excellent for evaluation. For example, "Recruitment message â‰¤150 words; 5 roles with specific counts (15-20 total)" provides clear constraints.

**Conclusion:** The `tasks.json` file is of **high quality**. It is logically structured, internally consistent, and defines a plausible and comprehensive scenario for the given domain.

## 2. Event Set Analysis (`event_set.json`)

The `event_set.json` file provides a set of challenges designed to test an AI's planning and adaptation skills.

### 2.1. Categorization and Coverage
- **Categories:** The five event categories (`GOAL_CONFLICT`, `COMPETITIVE_INTERACTION`, `MORAL_DILEMMA`, `AUTHORITY_DIRECTIVE`, `INFORMATION_GAP`) are well-defined in `EVENT.md` and represent a robust spectrum of real-world planning problems. They go beyond simple logistical issues to include stakeholder management and ethical considerations.
- **Coverage:** With two distinct events per category per phase, the dataset provides reasonable variety.

### 2.2. Plausibility and Realism
- **Scenarios:** The event narratives are highly plausible and reflect common issues in event management.
  - **Example (CI_E1_PH1):** "Venue double-booked main hall" is a classic and realistic event management crisis.
  - **Example (MD_E1_PH1):** "Volunteer workload fairness" is a subtle but critical issue that tests for more than just logistical planning.
  - **Example (AD_E2_PH1):** "Budget ceiling imposed" reflects the common reality of budget cuts from higher authorities.
- **Pressure Scaling:** The four pressure levels (low, medium, high, critical) for each event show a sensible escalation of impact. The `critical` variants consistently present scenarios that threaten the viability of the event without immediate and decisive action, which is appropriate for their label.

### 2.3. Consistency
- The content of the events aligns well with the tasks defined in `tasks.json`. For example, events related to budget, venue, and volunteers directly impact the plans that would be created in response to the tasks.

**Conclusion:** The `event_set.json` file is of **high quality**. The events are plausible, well-categorized, and demonstrate thoughtful scaling of pressure, making them excellent for evaluating resilience and adaptability.

## 3. Documentation Analysis (`.md` files)

The documentation (`README_methodology.md`, `TASK.md`, `EVENT.md`) provides context and instructions.

- **Clarity:** The documents are clearly written and effectively explain the structure, intent, and methodology of the dataset.
- **Consistency:** The information in the markdown files is fully consistent with the data in the JSON files. For example, the task list in `TASK.md` matches the titles in `tasks.json`.
- **Guidance:** The documentation provides clear guidance for both understanding the dataset and for how an AI assistant is expected to behave (e.g., "Never ignore events," "State new assumptions...explicitly").

**Conclusion:** The documentation is of **high quality** and provides excellent support for using the dataset.

## Overall Assessment

The `activity_planning` dataset is a **high-quality, well-structured, and internally consistent** benchmark.

- **Strengths:**
  - The task flow is logical and comprehensive.
  - The event system is robust, plausible, and covers a wide range of realistic challenges.
  - The constraints and figures are internally consistent and plausible for the specified domain.
  - The documentation is clear and thorough.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - As noted, the realism of specific figures (e.g., budget) could not be externally validated. However, they hold up to a plausibility check.

The dataset appears to be an excellent tool for evaluating an AI assistant's capabilities in planning, adaptation, and problem-solving within a realistic, constrained scenario.
